\title{Qserv: A Distributed Petascale Database for the LSST Catalogs}

\input{authors}

\begin{abstract}
Qserv is a distributed, shared-nothing, SQL database system being developed by the Vera Rubin Observatory to
host the multi-petabyte astronomical catalogs that will be produced by the LSST survey.  Here we sketch the
basic design and operating principles of Qserv, and provide some updates on recent developments.

\section{Introduction}

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time \citep{2019ApJ...873..111I} is a "deep fast wide" optical/near-IR survey
of half the sky in \emph{ugrizy} bands to \emph{r} 27.5 (36\,nJy) based on 825 visits over a 10-year period,
to be carried out by the Vera C.\ Rubin Observatory in Chile.

The astronomical catalogs to be produced by the survey are notionally described in \citet{LSE-163}, and the
corresponding database schema is described in \citet{LDM-153}.  By the 10th year of the survey, the catalog
database is expected to run to approximately 60 trillion rows, requiring more than 10 petabytes of storage
without consideration of replication or indices.
